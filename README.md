A portal is created by placing 8 obsidian in a square and placing one gold block in the middle. Then, you place a sign on top and put the text
```
[Portal]
name of portal
```
## Using portals on your own server
The plugin is made for 1.14 and is under the "target" folder. Take this jar file and put it into your servers plugins directory, and create a folder called "portals". Put a file in it named coordinateData.json, and fill this file with a `{}`.
